Programming Log

6/28
Hello, I finally decided to start a log for this project. It's late because I was unsure of whether or not I was going to commit to this project at the beginning. As you can see, I have started my log, and so: here's to a good project!

As of today, I have thought out my overall system for managing game states. I am working on getting menus off the ground. As of right now, I have the framework for a main menu/start screen. And I am now working on the character creation page. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I'm making the game in the order that the player would progress through it. My puny brain can't bear to think too far ahead into the future, and by doing this, I can base my assumptions off of code that has already been written. Because you can never know how things will go! I don't mean I don't know what direction I want the game to go in. I mean I don't know how I want to implement the code before the assumptions are taken care of. Otherwise, I'd have to do mental coding to plan out this game. Maybe after I write a couple games, I will already know what style of implementation I'm going to use, but for now: go with the flow.

Hello, Today I made a lot of progress. I finished the framework of the new game menu. I suspect that this is an unusually large amount of work, because of how different the style is compared to the game itself. I didnt log yesterday cause I didnt feel like I got much work done. Next step is to get some art for this menu, and move onto the game itself. I think the overall effort vs progress curve of developing this game will have many peaks early, but as the game gains some momentum, it'll be more content adding than framework building. I will be "inventing" less code near the end of the project is what I mean. Maybe that's obvious, but I'm looking forward to getting over the largest hump to come: building the framework for the game itself. One of the reasons why I picked this style of a game is because I wanted less code inventing. If I set out to make something like super smash brothers, I'd be making physics engines, platforms, all sorts of battle mechanics, and menus. In this game, I intend on everything to be grid based, and having only 2 action buttons, and possibly 1-9 as general buttons.

Hello, maybe I'll just log every two days regularly now since I don't usually make a signficant amount of progress in one day. Yesterday I got a better idea of how the saving and loading is going to work. I set up a load screen, and hopefully that system is near completion. It's sufficient right now, but who knows, I might run into a problem and need to update it eventually. Today I worked on pixel art, and jesus I am no artist. It's harder on my brain than any code has been, I'm completely unsatisfied with my work, and it takes a long long time. I have to make the critical decision soon of whether or not I'm going to hire an artist. I think I'm going to try one more time at the art (to at least get a basic understanding of what I'm hiring this person to do), then if I still can't produce satisfactoy results, I'll find a person. I already asked my sister but she is way too unmotivated. I think the biggest hurdle is that I cannot pay this person right now, and there is a low chance that this game will make enough money for me to pay them. I also really don't want to front the price because it'll come out of my parents' pocket. One option is, I last the next two months with shotty art by me. Then when school starts, I get a job and use that money to pay an artist. Not only will they have a lot to draw (ensuring the artist is catching up to me instead of waiting for me), but I will also know what I want. It'll be terrible to pay an artist to draw something, then not use it. This might be financially irrespincible thing to do though. This will be my first capital investment into this project, and that's scary. That means, if I fail, I actually lose something. But I'm not too worried about it, I'm getting a ridiculous amount of experience from this project, and I'd drop some money to get this off the ground. I think I'm going to encounter the same issue with the music. However, this issue will be for a much later time. Hopefully, late enough where I know at least that I wont lose money from the deal.

Hello, jk about logging every two days. I'm just gunna log whenever I feel like it. Since the last time I logged, I recruited my sister to touch up on the concept art I made. I also started on the framework for the actual game. I made an okay amount of progress. Nothing special, but also nothing to be ashamed of. There isn't much to say today. I added arrow icons to the new game and load game menus.

Hello, didn't really feel like working today. Touched up on asthetics. Nothing special.

Hello, it's been nearly a week since I worked on this project. I needed a break I guess. I'm back at it again though. I have a surgical procedure in two days. I hope that doesn't take time from this project. I shouldn't be on too many pain killers so I think I'll be fine. Today I made a good amount of progress though. Not enough to make up for a week, but I think it's enough to make up 1 day, 5 more makeup days to go haha. Anyways so today I got the character region transition/portal usage down. I finally got Selena to get off her ass a little and work on something. She either works really slowly, or I ask too much of her. The reason why I did the concept art was so that I could understand how long and what it takes to do that job. I guess without passion/motivation she just works slower than me. I tried to provide her with some motivation like doing her chores and blocking youtube otherwise. I guess these things are just too displaced from the project to be a logical 1 to 1 correlation in her brain. Since the link is my threat, the source/blame of the problem is not the work, it's me. And when a person is able to antagonize another entity other than themselves, that is where the loss of motivation occurs. Because a possible solution, or a more reasonable outcome, is that I always do the dishes or I never block youtube, then there is no concrete evidence that she has to do the work for me. However, if this was her own project, and if she wants it done, nobody else can be responcible, so she will get it done. At least, this is my theory. Maybe I made sence, maybe I didn't. The point I'm trying to make is that logical and direct consequences of not completing a task are much better motives to complete the task than fabricated motives that are not bound by the rules of logic. It's like current in parrellel. Current splits inversly proportional to the resistance of each route. If current = motivation and resistace = the inverse of the directness of the solution, then naturally, the series of events that are more direct (less resisitant) will get more motivation (current). If you eliminate the possibility of all easier way outs, the amount of motivation that goes into the only way left to get to the goal becomes 100%. Maybe I'm going crazy, who knows. Tomorrow I hope to figure out multithreading and moving relative to the clock. Ideally, if time and effort allows, I will also wrap up AI movement. That will be a large milestone. I will have to come up with the task after that later.
